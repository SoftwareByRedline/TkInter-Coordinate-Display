# TkInter-Coordinate-Display
This is a tool for those who make program GUIs in Python TkInter. No more calculations, estimations or guesswork, this tool can tell you exactly where to place widgets, draw objects and more!


----------------------
It works like this: 
- you set the dimensions of your conttainer/canvas
- you click somewhere on the window
- the system writes the coordinates below an X at the point
- You can repeat step two as many times as you want or clear the screen.

You can also enable the "Draw line" feature, which draws a polyline between your points.

It's a simple yet very helpful tool for Python TkInter.
